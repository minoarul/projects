            <h1>Welcome to Planet Zephyra</h1>
            <p>Planet Zephyra is a peaceful and magical world that orbits the radiant star Solara in the Velion system.
                Its sky glows softly in shades of blue and pink, and the wind carries gentle songs through the crystal
                valleys. Every sunrise fills the air with golden mist, and every sunset paints the horizon with
                shimmering light. Zephyra is known across galaxies as “The Planet of Whispering Winds,” where harmony
                and wisdom flow together.
                The people here believe that the wind carries not just air, but emotions and memories — making the
                entire planet feel alive. From space, Zephyra shines like a glowing pearl, surrounded by rings of silver
                dust that reflect its twin suns. It is a place where peace isn’t just practiced — it’s felt in every
                heartbeat and breath.</p>

            <h1>About Zephyra</h1>
            <p>Zephyra is a calm and balanced planet filled with glowing plains, shining lakes, and luminous forests
                that sparkle at night. The twin suns rise from opposite horizons, bathing the land in golden and violet
                light. A Zephyrian day lasts 36 hours — long enough to enjoy both work and leisure without hurry. Time
                on Zephyra flows gently, allowing life to unfold naturally.
                The planet’s energy comes from the purest forms of wind and light crystals. These crystals store and
                release energy in perfect balance, ensuring that progress never harms the environment. Zephyra’s beauty
                lies not only in its landscapes but also in its people’s promise — to live in peace with all living
                things and to protect the serenity that makes their home unique.</p>

            <h1>Geography and Climate</h1>
            <p>Zephyra has five breathtaking regions — the Crystal Valleys, Azure Plains, Lumora Mountains, Whispering
                Sea, and Halo Desert. The Crystal Valleys are filled with glowing stones that hum softly in the wind,
                while the Azure Plains stretch endlessly with blue grass that shimmers under moonlight. The Lumora
                Mountains are sacred, said to hold the oldest temples where ancient Zephyrians first learned to harness
                wind energy. The Whispering Sea is calm and full of coral islands that float gently, their movements
                guided by the planet’s soft tides. The Halo Desert glitters with golden sands that reflect light so
                beautifully it appears to shine like a mirror from space.
                The planet’s climate is stable and mild. Rain falls in gentle mists, winds blow softly, and the
                temperature remains comfortable all year. Zephyra’s weather reflects its people — peaceful, balanced,
                and full of quiet strength.</p>

            <h1>Inhabitants of Zephyra</h1>
            <p>The Zephyrians are tall, graceful beings with luminous skin that subtly changes color with emotion. Their
                eyes glow softly in shades of blue, silver, or green, depending on their mood and environment. They
                communicate through both speech and light signals, making every conversation a blend of sound and color.
                Zephyrians believe that beauty and peace come from within, so they spend time meditating, learning, and
                helping others.
                Their homes grow from living crystal — a special material that expands using sunlight and air. These
                homes breathe, heal, and adjust temperature naturally. Zephyrians live in small communities surrounded
                by gardens, lakes, and art domes. Every person contributes to society according to their passion —
                scientists, artists, healers, and wind engineers all live in harmony without greed or competition.</p>

        <link href="Culture">
        <div class="all">
            <h1>Culture and Lifestyle</h1>
            <p>Life on Zephyra flows like music. Every morning begins with a gentle melody played by the wind passing
                through crystal flutes placed in open towers. Art is not a hobby here — it’s a way of expressing emotion
                and connecting to nature. People paint with glowing pigments, carve sculptures from wind-blown sand, and
                compose songs that imitate the rhythm of the planet.
                Children are encouraged to learn through curiosity and discovery. Instead of exams, they share what they
                learn by creating art, storytelling, or building small inventions. Evenings on Zephyra are filled with
                community gatherings under open skies, where people share meals made from glowing fruits and sing songs
                of gratitude. Every festival celebrates peace, creation, and renewal, reminding everyone that joy and
                calm can coexist beautifully.</p>

        <div class="all">
            <h1>Flora and Fauna</h1>
            <p>The wildlife of Zephyra is both fascinating and peaceful. The Lunabirds are small glowing creatures that
                sing during sunrise and help spread flower seeds across valleys. Mira Beasts are gentle, furry giants
                that plow fields with their broad feet, leaving the soil fertile. Ethershrooms glow in the forests and
                light up paths for travelers at night. Glowvines float in the air, wrapping themselves around homes to
                give natural light.
                The forests are rich with plants that can purify air and water, and even communicate through vibration.
                Hunters do not exist on Zephyra — instead, all creatures live within a balanced ecosystem. Zephyrians
                believe that harming one species disturbs the entire cycle of life, so protection of nature is treated
                as a sacred duty.</p>

            <h1>Technology and Energy</h1>
            <p>Technology on Zephyra is deeply connected to nature. Instead of heavy machines or pollution, they use
                wind-lattice systems — invisible energy networks powered by the planet’s soft currents. Every home,
                city, and ship runs on clean wind and light energy. Air gliders, powered by crystal wings, move silently
                through the sky, leaving no smoke or noise.
                Zephyrians also developed Resonance Recycling, a process that converts waste into pure energy through
                sound frequencies. Communication devices project soft light rings instead of sound waves, allowing
                thoughts to be shared clearly. For Zephyrians, the goal of technology is not control, but balance —
                every invention must make life simpler and the planet healthier.</p>

    <div class="rules">

        <div class="all">
            <h1>Rules of My Planet</h1>
            <p>The Zephyrian Code teaches that life is sacred and peace is power. Every citizen must respect nature’s
                rhythm and take only what they truly need. Truth must be spoken softly and with kindness, for harsh
                words can wound more deeply than weapons. Violence and revenge are forbidden; problems are solved
                through understanding and unity. Creativity is celebrated — every Zephyrian must try to create something
                beautiful, no matter how small.
                Silence is also honored — each day has an hour of quiet, where everyone listens to the wind to find
                peace within. Protecting the weak is seen as a symbol of real strength, and wisdom must be shared freely
                with others. Time is valued above wealth, and visitors are welcomed warmly as part of the planetary
                family. Above all, Zephyrians believe in leaving every place better than they found it — whether it’s a
                garden, a friendship, or their world itself.</p>
